# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Priority Guidelines

When generating code for this repository:

1. **Version Compatibility**: Always detect and respect the exact versions of languages, frameworks, and libraries used
   in this project
2. **Context Files**: Prioritize patterns and standards defined in the .github/copilot directory
3. **Codebase Patterns**: When context files don't provide specific guidance, scan the codebase for established patterns
4. **Architectural Consistency**: Maintain our CLEAN ARCHITECTURE architectural style and established boundaries
5. **Code Quality**: Prioritize maintainability, performance, security, accessibility, and testability in all generated
   code

## Technology Version Detection

Before generating code, scan the codebase to identify:

1. **Language Versions**: Detect the exact versions of programming languages in use

    - Examine project files, configuration files, and package managers
    - Look for language-specific version indicators (e.g., TypeScript target in tsconfig.json)
    - Never use language features beyond the detected version

2. **Framework Versions**: Identify the exact versions of all frameworks

    - Check package.json, angular.json, etc.
    - Respect version constraints when generating code
    - Never suggest features not available in the detected framework versions

3. **Library Versions**: Note the exact versions of key libraries and dependencies
    - Generate code compatible with these specific versions
    - Never use APIs or features not available in the detected versions

## Context Files

Prioritize the following files in .github/copilot directory (if they exist):

-   **architecture.md**: System architecture guidelines
-   **tech-stack.md**: Technology versions and framework details
-   **coding-standards.md**: Code style and formatting standards
-   **folder-structure.md**: Project organization guidelines
-   **exemplars.md**: Exemplary code patterns to follow

## Codebase Scanning Instructions

When context files don't provide specific guidance:

1. Identify similar files to the one being modified or created
2. Analyze patterns for:
    - Naming conventions
    - Code organization
    - Error handling
    - Logging approaches
    - Documentation style
    - Testing patterns
3. Follow the most consistent patterns found in the codebase
4. When conflicting patterns exist, prioritize patterns in newer files or files with higher test coverage
5. Never introduce patterns not found in the existing codebase

## Code Quality Standards

## Technology-Specific Guidelines

### Angular Guidelines

-   Detect and adhere to the specific Angular version in use
-   Follow the same component and module patterns found in the codebase
-   Match decorator usage exactly as seen in existing code
-   Apply the same RxJS patterns found in the codebase
-   Follow existing patterns for component communication

### JavaScript/TypeScript Guidelines

-   Detect and adhere to the specific ECMAScript/TypeScript version in use
-   Follow the same module import/export patterns found in the codebase
-   Match TypeScript type definitions with existing patterns
-   Use the same async patterns (promises, async/await) as existing code
-   Follow error handling patterns from similar files

## Version Control Guidelines

-   Follow Semantic Versioning patterns as applied in the codebase
-   Match existing patterns for documenting breaking changes
-   Follow the same approach for deprecation notices

## General Best Practices

-   Use the same approach to configuration as seen in the codebase

## Project-Specific Guidance

-   Scan the codebase thoroughly before generating any code
-   Respect existing architectural boundaries without exception
-   Match the style and patterns of surrounding code
-   When in doubt, prioritize consistency with existing code over external best practices
